# Questions

- Do we have standards?

  - TypeScript
  - Comments (JSDocs?)
  - Markdown (Instructions)
  - Deployment Process / Cloud Native Projects

    - Which projects do we use for the pipeline?'

  - Cloud native = on the cloud, or specific 

  - Confirm data flow:

    - Service is called with IP address argument (ipv4 format?)
    - Service returns true (if in blocklist) or false (if not found)
      - Anything else that needs to be returned?

  - Can we make the assumption that everyone has Node installed?
  - Which ECMAScript do we use as the target in tsconfig?

- Deliverable check IP "listed in any sources" -- do we have an exhaustive list of sources or does this refer to the `blocklist-ipsets` as sources?
